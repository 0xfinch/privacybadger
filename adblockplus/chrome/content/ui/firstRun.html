    <p> Nothing can stop the Privacy Badger from eating web trackers when it's hungry!</p>
    <p> This extension automatically protects your privacy from third party trackers that load invisibly when you browse the web. We send the Do Not Track header with each request, and our extension figures out if you are still being tracked. If so, we automatically block your request from being sent to the spying tracker. Our extension has three states. Red means block the tracker. Yellow means that we don't send cookies or referers to the tracker. Green means unblocked (probably because the third party does not appear to be tracking you). You can toggle these by clicking the icon in the top right of a page if you wish to override the settings. Or, you can sit back and watch as Privacy Badger starts finding and eating up web trackers one by one! </p>
    <p> Privacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a fork of the Adblock Plus repo! The text of this file is in adblockplus/chrome/content/ui/firstRun.html </p>
